Red Black Tree
C++ Programming
Mr. Galbraith
Project Completed: 4/14/2023
Outside Sources Used:
 - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/insertion-in-red-black-tree/   for logic.
 - https://algorithmtutor.com/Data-Structures/Tree/Red-Black-Trees/   another perspective on logic.
 - https://www.codesdope.com/course/data-structures-red-black-trees-insertion/   for logic, specifically for rotations. Used pseudocode to build my rotation code.
 - https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/RedBlack.html   for visualization of RBT concepts and for checking my work.

This project emulates a Red-Black Tree, which is a binary search tree that can (roughly) rebalance itself. So far, the tree can be built, either manually or by file input, printed, and searched.
