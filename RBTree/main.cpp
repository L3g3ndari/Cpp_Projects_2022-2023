Insertion Completed: 4/19/2023
Deletion Completed: 5/19/2023
Outside Sources Used:
 - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/insertion-in-red-black-tree/   for logic.
 - https://algorithmtutor.com/Data-Structures/Tree/Red-Black-Trees/   another perspective on logic.
 - https://www.codesdope.com/course/data-structures-red-black-trees-insertion/   for logic, specifically for rotations. Used pseudocode to build my rotation code.
 - https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/RedBlack.html   for visualization of RBT concepts and for checking my work.
 - Used the pseudo-code from programming textbook that Mr. Galbraith provided to help with rewriting deleteFix.

This project emulates a Red-Black Tree, which is a binary search tree that can (roughly) rebalance itself. The tree can be built, either manually or by file input, printed, searched, and deleted from. This was one of the most difficult projects of my life.
